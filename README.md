# Project Name

Guilt Trip Advisor - Q&A Component

This is a reverse-engineered copy of a "Questions & Answers" component found on Tripadvisor.com's Restaurants section.

This component was created by Jeremy Sim in March 2020 as part of a software engineering exercise at HackReactor Seattle. The goal was to replicate an existing website module as closely as possible in looks and functionality, from scratch.

It utilizes a MongoDB database, a server written using Express, and a React architecture for the client-facing front end.

Collaborating team members, who each worked on a separate component, were Katharine Celentano, Sethaniel Way, and Phonxay Champasouk.
